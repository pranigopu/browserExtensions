0,The AK-47 officially known as the Avtomat Kalashnikov Russian Автомат Калашникова lit automatic rifle also known as the Kalashnikov or just AK is a gas-operated assault rifle that is chambered for the 7.62×39mm cartridge Developed in the Soviet Union by Russian small-arms designer Mikhail Kalashnikov it is the originating firearm of the Kalashnikov or AK family of rifles After more than seven decades the AK-47 model and its variants remain the most popular and widely used rifles in the world
1,The number 47 refers to the year the rifle was finished Design work on the AK-47 began in 1945 It was presented for official military trials in 1947 and in 1948 the fixed-stock version was introduced into active service for selected units of the Soviet Army In early 1949 the AK was officially accepted by the Soviet Armed Forces 9 and used by the majority of the member states of the Warsaw Pact
2,The model and its variants owe their global popularity to their reliability under harsh conditions low production cost compared to contemporary weapons availability in virtually every geographic region and ease of use The AK has been manufactured in many countries and has seen service with armed forces as well as irregular forces and insurgencies throughout the world As of 2004 update of the estimated 500 million firearms worldwide approximately 100 million belong to the Kalashnikov family three-quarters of which are AK-47s 4 The model is the basis for the development of many other types of individual crew-served and specialised firearms
3,During World War II the Sturmgewehr 44 rifle used by German forces made a deep impression on their Soviet counterparts 10 11 The select-fire rifle was chambered for a new intermediate cartridge the 7.92×33mm Kurz and combined the firepower of a submachine gun with the range and accuracy of a rifle 12 13 On 15 July 1943 an earlier model of the Sturmgewehr was demonstrated before the People Commissariat of Arms of the USSR 14 The Soviets were impressed with the weapon and immediately set about developing an intermediate caliber fully automatic rifle of their own 10 11 to replace the PPSh-41 submachine guns and outdated Mosin–Nagant bolt-action rifles that armed most of the Soviet Army 15
4,The Soviets soon developed the 7.62×39mm M43 cartridge which is used in 14 the semi-automatic SKS carbine and the RPD light machine gun 16 Shortly after World War II the Soviets developed the AK-47 rifle which quickly replaced the SKS in Soviet service 17 18 Introduced in 1959 the AKM is a lighter stamped steel version and the most ubiquitous variant of the entire AK series of firearms In the 1960s the Soviets introduced the RPK light machine gun an AK type weapon with a stronger receiver a longer heavy barrel and a bipod that eventually replaced the RPD light machine gun 16
5,Mikhail Kalashnikov began his career as a weapon designer in 1941 while recuperating from a shoulder wound which he received during the Battle of Bryansk 5 19 Kalashnikov himself stated I was in the hospital and a soldier in the bed beside me asked do our soldiers have only one rifle for two or three of our men when the Germans have automatics So I designed one I was a soldier and I created a machine gun for a soldier It was called an Avtomat Kalashnikova the automatic weapon of Kalashnikov—AK—and it carried the year of its first manufacture 1947 20
6,The AK-47 is best described as a hybrid of previous rifle technology innovations Kalashnikov decided to design an automatic rifle combining the best features of the American M1 and the German StG 44 21 Kalashnikov team had access to these weapons and had no need to reinvent the wheel Kalashnikov himself observed A lot of Russian Army soldiers ask me how one can become a constructor and how new weaponry is designed These are very difficult questions Each designer seems to have his own paths his own successes and failures But one thing is clear before attempting to create something new it is vital to have a good appreciation of everything that already exists in this field I myself have had many experiences confirming this to be so 19
7,There are claims about Kalashnikov copying other designs like Bulkin TKB-415 22 or Simonov AVS-31 23
8,Kalashnikov started work on a submachine gun design in 1942 24 and with a light machine gun design in 1943 25 26 Early in 1944 Kalashnikov was given some 7.62×39mm M43 cartridges and was informed that there were other designers working on weapons for this new Soviet small-arms cartridge It was suggested that a new weapon might well lead to greater things He then undertook work on the new rifle 27 In 1944 he entered a design competition with this new 7.62×39mm semi-automatic gas-operated long stroke piston carbine strongly influenced by the American M1 Garand 28 This new rifle was in the same class as the SKS-45 carbine with a fixed magazine and a gas tube above the barrel 27 However the new Kalashnikov design lost out to a Simonov design 29
9,In 1946 a new design competition was initiated to develop a new rifle 30 Kalashnikov submitted an entry It was gas-operated rifle with a short-stroke gas piston above the barrel a breech-block mechanism similar to his 1944 carbine and a curved 30-round magazine 31 Kalashnikov rifles AK-1 with a milled receiver and AK-2 with a stamped receiver proved to be reliable weapons and were accepted to a second round of competition along with other designs
10,These prototypes also known as the AK-46 had a rotary bolt a two-part receiver with separate trigger unit housing dual controls separate safety and fire selector switches and a non-reciprocating charging handle located on the left side of the weapon 31 32 This design had many similarities to the StG 44 33 In late 1946 as the rifles were being tested one of Kalashnikov assistants Aleksandr Zaitsev suggested a major redesign to improve reliability At first Kalashnikov was reluctant given that their rifle had already fared better than its competitors Eventually however Zaitsev managed to persuade Kalashnikov
11,In November 1947 the new prototypes AK-47s were completed It used a long-stroke gas piston above the barrel The upper and lower receivers were combined into a single receiver The selector and safety were combined into a single control-lever/dust-cover on the right side of the rifle And the bolt-handle was simply attached to the bolt-carrier This simplified the design and production of the rifle The first army trial series began in early 1948 34 The new rifle proved to be reliable under a wide range of conditions with convenient handling characteristics In 1949 it was adopted by the Soviet Army as 7.62 mm Kalashnikov rifle AK 9
12,There were many difficulties during the initial phase of production The first production models had stamped sheet metal receivers with a milled trunnion and butt stock insert and a stamped body Difficulties were encountered in welding the guide and ejector rails causing high rejection rates 35 Instead of halting production a heavy N 1 machined receiver was substituted for the sheet metal receiver Even though production of these milled rifles started in 1951 they were officially referred to as AK-49 based on the date their development started but they are much widely known in the collectors and current commercial market as Type 2 AK-47 36 37 This was a more costly process but the use of machined receivers accelerated production as tooling and labor for the earlier Mosin–Nagant rifle machined receiver were easily adapted 38 Partly because of these problems the Soviets were not able to distribute large numbers of the new rifle to soldiers until 1956 During this time production of the interim SKS rifle continued 35
13,Once the manufacturing difficulties of non-milled receivers had been overcome a redesigned version designated the AKM M for modernized or upgraded in Russian Автомат Калашникова Модернизированный Avtomat Kalashnikova Modernizirovanniy was introduced in 1959 36 This new model used a stamped sheet metal receiver and featured a slanted muzzle brake on the end of the barrel to compensate for muzzle rise under recoil In addition a hammer retarder was added to prevent the weapon from firing out of battery without the bolt being fully closed during rapid or fully automatic fire 35 This is also sometimes referred to as a cyclic rate reducer or simply rate reducer as it also has the effect of reducing the number of rounds fired per minute during fully automatic fire It was also roughly one-third lighter than the previous model 36
14,Both licensed and unlicensed production of the Kalashnikov weapons abroad were almost exclusively of the AKM variant partially due to the much easier production of the stamped receiver This model is the most commonly encountered having been produced in much greater quantities All rifles based on the Kalashnikov design are frequently referred to as AK-47s in the West although this is only correct when applied to rifles based on the original three receiver types 39 In most former Eastern Bloc countries the weapon is known simply as the Kalashnikov or AK The differences between the milled and stamped receivers includes the use of rivets rather than welds on the stamped receiver as well as the placement of a small dimple above the magazine well for stabilization of the magazine
15,In 1974 the Soviets began replacing their AK-47 and AKM rifles with a newer design the AK-74 which uses 5.45×39mm ammunition This new rifle and cartridge had only started to be manufactured in Eastern European nations when the Soviet Union collapsed drastically slowing production of the AK-74 and other weapons of the former Soviet bloc
16,The AK-47 was designed to be a simple reliable fully automatic rifle that could be manufactured quickly and cheaply using mass production methods that were state of the art in the Soviet Union during the late 1940s 40 The AK-47 uses a long stroke gas system that is generally associated with great reliability in adverse conditions 28 41 42 The large gas piston generous clearances between moving parts and tapered cartridge case design allow the gun to endure large amounts of foreign matter and fouling without failing to cycle
17,"The AK fires the 7.62×39mm cartridge with a muzzle velocity of 715 m/s 2,350 ft/s 8 The cartridge weight is 16.3 g 0.6 oz the projectile weight is 7.9 g 122 gr 43 The original Soviet M43 bullets are 123 grain boat-tail bullets with a copper-plated steel jacket a large steel core and some lead between the core and the jacket The AK has excellent penetration when shooting through heavy foliage walls or a common vehicle metal body and into an opponent attempting to use these things as cover The 7.62×39mm M43 projectile does not generally fragment when striking an opponent and has an unusual tendency to remain intact even after making contact with bone The 7.62×39mm round produces significant wounding in cases where the bullet tumbles yaws in tissue 44 but produces relatively minor wounds in cases where the bullet exits before beginning to yaw 45 46 47 In the absence of yaw the M43 round can pencil through tissue with relatively little injury 45 48"
18,Most if not all of the 7.62×39mm ammunition found today is of the upgraded M67 variety This variety deleted the steel insert shifting the center of gravity rearward and allowing the projectile to destabilize or yaw at about 3.3 in 8.4 cm nearly 6.7 in 17 cm earlier in tissue than the M43 round 49 This change also reduces penetration in ballistic gelatin to in 64 cm for the newer M67 round versus in 74 cm for the older M43 round 49 50 However the wounding potential of M67 is mostly limited to the small permanent wound channel the bullet itself makes especially when the bullet yaws 49
19,To fire the operator inserts a loaded magazine pulls back and releases the charging handle and then pulls the trigger In semi-automatic the firearm fires only once requiring the trigger to be released and depressed again for the next shot In fully automatic the rifle continues to fire automatically cycling fresh rounds into the chamber until the magazine is exhausted or pressure is released from the trigger After ignition of the cartridge primer and propellant rapidly expanding propellant gases are diverted into the gas cylinder above the barrel through a vent near the muzzle The build-up of gases inside the gas cylinder drives the long-stroke piston and bolt carrier rearward and a cam guide machined into the underside of the bolt carrier along with an ejector spur on the bolt carrier rail guide rotates the bolt approximately 35° and unlocks it from the barrel extension via a camming pin on the bolt The moving assembly has about 5.5 mm 0.2 in of free travel which creates a delay between the initial recoil impulse of the piston and the bolt unlocking sequence allowing gas pressures to drop to a safe level before the seal between the chamber and the bolt is broken The AK-47 does not have a gas valve excess gases are ventilated through a series of radial ports in the gas cylinder The Kalashnikov operating system offers no primary extraction upon bolt rotation but uses an extractor claw to eject the spent cartridge case 51
20,The rifle received a barrel with a chrome-lined bore and four right-hand grooves at a 240 mm 1 in 9.45 in or 31.5 calibers rifling twist rate The gas block contains a gas channel that is installed at a slanted angle in relation to the bore axis The muzzle is threaded for the installation of various muzzle devices such as a muzzle brake or a blank-firing adaptor
21,The gas block of the AK-47 features a cleaning rod capture or sling loop Gas relief ports that alleviate gas pressure are placed horizontally in a row on the gas cylinder
22,The fire selector is a large lever located on the right side of the rifle it acts as a dust-cover and prevents the charging handle from being pulled fully to the rear when it is on safe 52 It is operated by the shooter right fore-fingers and has 3 settings safe up full-auto center and semi-auto down 52 The reason for this is that under stress a soldier will push the selector lever down with considerable force bypassing the full-auto stage and setting the rifle to semi-auto 52 To set the AK-47 to full-auto requires the deliberate action of centering the selector lever 52 To operate the fire selector lever right handed shooters have to briefly remove their right hand from the pistol grip which is ergonomically sub-optimal Some AK-type rifles also have a more traditional selector lever on the left side of the receiver just above the pistol grip 52 This lever is operated by the shooter right thumb and has three settings safe forward full-auto center and semi-auto backward 52
23,The AK-47 uses a notched rear tangent iron sight calibrated in 100 m 109 yd increments from 100 to 800 m 109 to 875 yd 53 The front sight is a post adjustable for elevation in the field Horizontal adjustment requires a special drift tool and is done by the armory before issue or if the need arises by an armorer after issue The sight line elements are approximately 48.5 mm 1.9 in over the bore axis The point-blank range battle zero setting П standing for постоянная constant on the 7.62×39mm AK-47 rear tangent sight element corresponds to a 300 m 328 yd zero 53 54 These settings mirror the Mosin–Nagant and SKS rifles which the AK-47 replaced For the AK-47 combined with service cartridges the 300 m battle zero setting limits the apparent bullet rise within approximately to cm to 12.2 in relative to the line of sight Soldiers are instructed to fire at any target within this range by simply placing the sights on the center of mass the belt buckle according to Russian and former Soviet doctrine of the enemy target Any errors in range estimation are tactically irrelevant as a well-aimed shot will hit the torso of the enemy soldier Some AK-type rifles have a front sight with a flip-up luminous dot that is calibrated at 50 m 55 yd for improved night fighting 53
24,The AK-47 was originally equipped with a buttstock handguard and an upper heat guard made from solid wood With the introduction of the Type 3 receiver the buttstock lower handguard and upper heatguard were manufactured from birch plywood laminates 38 Such engineered woods are stronger and resist warping better than the conventional one-piece patterns do not require lengthy maturing and are cheaper The wooden furniture was finished with the Russian amber shellac finishing process citation needed AKS and AKMS models featured a downward-folding metal butt-stock similar to that of the German MP40 submachine-gun for use in the restricted space in the BMP infantry combat vehicle as well as by paratroops All 100 series AKs use plastic furniture with side-folding stocks
25,The standard magazine capacity is 30 rounds There are also 10 20 and 40-round box magazines as well as 75-round drum magazines
26,The AK-47 standard 30-round magazines have a pronounced curve that allows them to smoothly feed ammunition into the chamber Their heavy steel construction combined with feed-lips the surfaces at the top of the magazine that control the angle at which the cartridge enters the chamber machined from a single steel billet makes them highly resistant to damage These magazines are so strong that Soldiers have been known to use their mags as hammers and even bottle openers 55 56 This contributes to the AK-47 magazine being more reliable but makes it heavier than U.S. and NATO magazines
27,The early slab-sided steel AK-47 30-round detachable box magazines had 1 mm 0.039 in sheet-metal bodies and weighed 0.43 kg 0.95 lb empty 42 The later steel AKM 30-round magazines had lighter sheet-metal bodies with prominent reinforcing ribs weighing 0.33 kg 0.73 lb empty 42 57 To further reduce weight a lightweight magazine with an aluminum body with a prominent reinforcing waffle rib pattern weighing 0.19 kg 0.42 lb empty was developed for the AKM that proved to be too fragile and the small issued amount of these magazines was quickly withdrawn from service 58 As a replacement steel-reinforced 30-round plastic 7.62×39mm box magazines were introduced These rust-colored magazines weigh 0.24 kg 0.53 lb empty and are often mistakenly identified as being made of Bakelite a phenolic resin but were actually fabricated from two-parts of AG-S4 molding compound a glass-reinforced phenol-formaldehyde binder impregnated composite assembled using an epoxy resin adhesive 59 60 61 Noted for their durability these magazines did however compromise the rifle camouflage and lacked the small horizontal reinforcing ribs running down both sides of the magazine body near the front that were added on all later plastic magazine generations 61 A second generation steel-reinforced dark-brown color shades vary from maroon to plum to near black 30-round 7.62×39mm magazine was introduced in the early 1980s fabricated from ABS plastic The third generation steel-reinforced 30-round 7.62×39mm magazine is similar to the second generation but is darker colored and has a matte nonreflective surface finish The current issue steel-reinforced matte true black nonreflective surface finished 7.62×39mm 30-round magazines fabricated from ABS plastic weigh 0.25 kg 0.55 lb empty 8
28,Early steel AK-47 magazines are 9.75 in 248 mm long the later ribbed steel AKM and newer plastic 7.62×39mm magazines are about 1 in 25 mm shorter 62 63
29,The transition from steel to mainly plastic magazines yields a significant weight reduction and allows a soldier to carry more ammunition for the same weight
30,All 7.62×39mm AK magazines are backwards compatible with older AK variants
31,10.12 kg 22.3 lb is the maximum amount of ammo that the average soldier can comfortably carry It also allows for best comparison of the three most common 7.62×39mm AK magazines citation needed
32,Most Yugoslavian and some East German AK magazines were made with cartridge followers that hold the bolt open when empty however most AK magazine followers allow the bolt to close when the magazine is empty citation needed
33,Accessories supplied with the rifle include a 387 mm 15.2 in long 6H3 bayonet featuring a 200 mm 7.9 in long spear point blade The AK-47 bayonet is installed by slipping the 17.7 mm 0.70 in diameter muzzle ring around the muzzle and latching the handle down on the bayonet lug under the front sight base 64
34,All current model AKM rifles can mount under-barrel 40 mm grenade launchers such as the GP-25 and its variants which can fire up to 20 rounds per minute and have an effective range of up to 400 metres 65 The main grenade is the VOG-25 VOG-25M fragmentation grenade which has a 6 m 9 m 20 ft 30 ft lethality radius The VOG-25P/VOG-25PM jumping variant explodes 0.5–1 metre 1.6–3.3 ft above the ground 66
35,The AK-47 can also mount a rarely used cup-type grenade launcher the Kalashnikov grenade launcher that fires standard RGD-5 Soviet hand-grenades The maximum effective range is approximately 150 meters 67 This launcher can also be used to launch tear-gas and riot control grenades
36,All current AKs 100 series and some older models have side rails for mounting a variety of scopes and sighting devices such as the PSO-1 Optical Sniper Sight 68 The side rails allow for the removal and remounting of optical accessories without interfering with the zeroing of the optic However the 100 series side folding stocks can not be folded with the optics mounted
37,"The AK-47 and its variants have been and are made in dozens of countries with quality ranging from finely engineered weapons to pieces of questionable workmanship 69 As a result the AK-47 has a service/system life of approximately 6,000 70 to 10,000 71 to 15,000 72 rounds The AK-47 was designed to be a cheap simple easy to manufacture rifle 73 perfectly matching Soviet military doctrine that treats equipment and weapons as disposable items 74 As units are often deployed without adequate logistical support and dependent on battlefield cannibalization for resupply it is actually more cost-effective to replace rather than repair weapons 74"
38,The AK-47 has small parts and springs that need to be replaced every few thousand rounds However Every time it is disassembled beyond the field stripping stage it will take some time for some parts to regain their fit some parts may tend to shake loose and fall out when firing the weapon Some parts of the AK-47 line are riveted together Repairing these can be quite a hassle since the end of the rivet has to be ground off and a new one set after the part is replaced 53

41,A private company Kalashnikov Concern formerly Izhmash from Russia has repeatedly claimed that the majority of foreign manufacturers are producing AK-type rifles without proper licensing 96 97
42,The AK-47 accuracy has always been considered by whom to be good enough to hit an adult male torso out to about 300 m 328 yd 98 99 though even experts firing from prone or bench rest positions at this range were observed to have difficulty placing ten consecutive rounds on target 100 Later designs did not significantly improve its accuracy 100 An AK can fire a 10-shot group of 5.9 in 15 cm at 100 m 109 yd 101 and 17.5 in 44 cm at 300 m 328 yd 100 The newer stamped-steel receiver AKM models while more rugged and less prone to metal fatigue are actually less accurate than the forged/milled receivers of their predecessors the milled AK-47s are capable of shooting 3 to 5 in 8 to 13 cm groups at 100 yd 91 m whereas the stamped AKMs are capable of shooting 4 to 6 in 10 to 15 cm groups at 100 yd 91 m 99
43,The best shooters are able to hit a man-sized target at 800 m 875 yd within five shots firing from prone or bench rest position or ten shots standing 102
44,The single-shot hit-probability on the NATO E-type Silhouette Target a human upper body half and head silhouette of the AK-47 and the later developed AK-74 M16A1 and M16A2 rifles were measured by the US military under ideal proving ground conditions in the 1980s as follows
45,Under worst field exercise circumstances the hit probabilities for all the tested rifles were drastically reduced 34 at 50m down to 3–4 at 600m with no significant differences between weapons at each range 103
46,The following table represents the Russian method for determining accuracy which is far more complex than Western methods In the West one fires a group of shots into the target and then simply measures the overall diameter of the group The Russians on the other hand fire a group of shots into the target They then draw two circles on the target one for the maximum vertical dispersion of hits and one for the maximum horizontal dispersion of hits They then disregard the hits on the outer part of the target and only count half of the hits 50 or R50 on the inner part of the circles This dramatically reduces the overall diameter of the groups They then use both the vertical and horizontal measurements of the reduced groups to measure accuracy This circular error probable method used by the Russians and other European militaries can not be converted and is not comparable to US military methods for determining rifle accuracy When the R50 results are doubled the hit probability increases to 93.7
47,The vertical and horizontal mean R50 deviations with service ammunition at 800 m 875 yd for AK platforms are
48,"Throughout the world the AK and its variants are commonly used by governments revolutionaries terrorists criminals and civilians alike In some countries such as Somalia Rwanda Mozambique Congo and Tanzania the prices for Black Market AKs are between 30 and 125 per weapon and prices have fallen in the last few decades due to mass counterfeiting 133 In Kenya an AK-47 fetches five head of cattle about 10,000 Kenya shillings or 100 U.S. dollars when offered for barter but costs almost half that price when cash is paid 134 There are places around the world where AK type weapons can be purchased on the black market for as little as 6 or traded for a chicken or a sack of grain 135 136 137"
49,The AK-47 has also spawned a cottage industry of sorts and has been copied and manufactured one gun at a time in small shops around the world see Khyber Pass Copy 138 139 The estimated numbers of AK-type weapons vary greatly The Small Arms Survey suggest that between 70 and 100 million of these weapons have been produced since 1947 140 The World Bank estimates that out of the 500 million total firearms available worldwide 100 million are of the Kalashnikov family and 75 million are AK-47s 4 Because AK-type weapons have been made in many countries often illicitly it is impossible to know how many really exist 141
50,The AK-47 has been used in the following conflicts
51,Basically it the anti-Western cachet of it And you know one man terrorist is another man freedom fighter so we all sort of think oh boy we got a little bit of Che Guevara in us And this accounts for the popularity of the AK 47 weapon Plus I think that in the United States it considered counterculture which is always something that citizens in this country kind of like It kind of sticking a finger in the eye of the man if you will
52,Larry Kahaner author of AK-47 The Weapon That Changed the Face of War 152
53,During the Cold War the Soviet Union and the People Republic of China as well as United States and other NATO nations supplied arms and technical knowledge to numerous countries and rebel forces around the world During this time the Western countries used relatively expensive automatic rifles such as the FN FAL the HK G3 the M14 and the M16 In contrast the Russians and Chinese used the AK-47 its low production cost and ease of manufacture allow them to make AKs in vast numbers
54,In the pro-communist states the AK-47 became a symbol of the Third World revolution They were utilized in the Cambodian Civil War and the Cambodian–Vietnamese War 153 During the 1980s the Soviet Union became the principal arms dealer to countries embargoed by Western nations including Middle Eastern nations such as Libya and Syria which welcomed Soviet Union backing against Israel After the fall of the Soviet Union AK-47s were sold both openly by whom and on the black market to any group with cash including drug cartels and dictatorial states and more recently they have been seen in the hands of Islamic groups such as Al-Qaeda ISIL and the Taliban in Afghanistan and Iraq and FARC Ejército de Liberación Nacional guerrillas in Colombia 152
55,In Russia the Kalashnikov is a tremendous source of national pride 154 The family of the inventor of the world most famous rifle Mikhail Kalashnikov has authorized German engineering company MMI to use the well-known Kalashnikov name on a variety of not-so-deadly goods 155 In recent years Kalashnikov Vodka has been marketed with souvenir bottles in the shape of the AK-47 Kalashnikov 156 157 There are also Kalashnikov watches 158 umbrellas 159 and knives 160 161
56,"The Kalashnikov Museum also called the AK-47 museum opened on 4 November 2004 in Izhevsk Udmurt Republic This city is in the Ural Region of Russia The museum chronicles the biography of General Kalashnikov and documents the invention of the AK-47 The museum complex of Kalashnikov small arms a series of halls and multimedia exhibitions are devoted to the evolution of the AK-47 rifle and attracts 10,000 monthly visitors 162 Nadezhda Vechtomova the museum director stated in an interview that the purpose of the museum is to honor the ingenuity of the inventor and the hard work of the employees and to separate the weapon as a weapon of murder from the people who are producing it and to tell its history in our country"
57,On 19 September 2017 a 9 metres 30 ft monument of Kalashnikov was unveiled in central Moscow A protester later detained by police attempted to unfurl a banner reading a creator of weapons is a creator of death 163
58,The proliferation of this weapon is reflected by more than just numbers The AK-47 is included on the flag of Mozambique and its emblem an acknowledgment that the country gained its independence in large part through the effective use of their AK-47s 164 It is also found in the coats of arms of East Timor Zimbabwe and the revolution era Burkina Faso as well as in the flags of Hezbollah Syrian Resistance FARC-EP the New People Army TKP/TIKKO and the International Revolutionary People Guerrilla Forces
59,U.S. and Western Europe countries frequently associate the AK-47 with their enemies both Cold War era and present-day For example Western works of fiction movies television novels video games often portray criminals gang members insurgents and terrorists using AK-47s as the weapon of choice Conversely throughout the developing world the AK-47 can be positively attributed with revolutionaries against foreign occupation imperialism or colonialism Numerous fictional depictions of the Soviet/Russian armed forces such as Call of Duty Modern Warfare show them armed with 7.62×39mm AK variants AK-47 or AKM as their standard-issue rifles a long-standing anachronism thanks to the AK-47 iconic status despite the Soviets having actually replaced them with the 5.45×39mm AK-74 in the 1970s Movies and video games often pass off licensed clones like the Norinco Type 56 rifle as the AK-47 152
60,In Ireland the AK-47 is associated with The Troubles due to its extensive use by republican paramilitaries during this period 165 In 2013 a decommissioned AK-47 was included in the A History of Ireland in 100 Objects collection 166
61,The AK-47 made an appearance in U.S. popular culture as a recurring focus in the Nicolas Cage film Lord of War 2005 Numerous monologues in the movie focus on the weapon and its effects on global conflict and the gun running market 167
62,In Iraq and Afghanistan private military company contractors from the U.K. and other countries used the AK-47 and its variants along with Western firearms such as the AR-15 168
63,"In 2006 the Colombian musician and peace activist César López devised the escopetarra an AK converted into a guitar One sold for US 17,000 in a fundraiser held to benefit the victims of anti-personnel mines while another was exhibited at the United Nations Conference on Disarmament 169"
64,In Mexico the AK-47 is known as Cuerno de Chivo literally Goat Horn because of its curved magazine design It is one of the weapons of choice of Mexican drug cartels It is sometimes mentioned in Mexican folk music lyrics 170
